niebla
========

Python package to compute the EBL with a forward folding approach.


Prerequisites
-------------

Python 3.5 or higher and the following packages: 
    - numpy 
    - scipy
    - astropy

An extra library is required to calculate the intensity of the
intrahalo light. However, implementing it is not trivial in a
virtual enviroment, I would not reccomend to get stuck trying to
implement it if it is not needed:
    - hmf

Installation:
------------

You can use pip to install the package:: 

    pip install niebla

Example scripts and notebooks are provided on the github page in the
scripts/ and notebooks/ folder, https://github.com/
